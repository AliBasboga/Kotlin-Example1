# What is Kotlin‚ùì

`Kotlin` is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference. `Kotlin` is designed to interoperate fully with `Java` and the `JVM` version of Kotlin's standard library depends on the `Java` Class Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise.
